youtube-dl is a small command-line program to download videos from
YouTube.com and a few more sites. It requires the Python interpreter,
version 2.x (x being at least 5), and it is not platform specific. It
should work in your Unix box, in Windows or in Mac OS X. It is
released to the PUBLIC DOMAIN, which means you can modify it,
redistribute it or use it however you like. The project is currently
being developed at github.com. 

I will try to keep it updated if YouTube.com changes the way you
access their videos. After all, it is a simple and short
program. However, I can not guarantee anything. If you detect it stops
working, check for new versions and/or inform me about the problem,
indicating the program version you are using. My contact information
is at rg03.wordpress.com. If the program stops working and I can not
solve the problem but you have a solution, I would like to know
it. Furthermore, if you think you can maintain the program yourself,
tell me. 

Thanks for all the feedback received so far. I am glad people find my
program useful.
