youtube-dl - download videos from youtube.com

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  youtube-dl [options] url ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

youtube-dl is a script to download videos from youtube.com.

Once it is installed in your system, you should be able to call it from
the command line. Usage instructions are easy. Use youtube-dl followed
by a video URL or identifier. As an example, consider:

  youtube-dl "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foobar"

The video will be saved to the file C<foobar.flv> in that example. Many
YouTube.com videos are in Flash Video format and their extension would
be C<flv>. Other videos are encoded in H.264 and these usually have the
extension C<mp4>.  In Linux and other unices, video players using a
recent version of ffmpeg can play them. That includes MPlayer, VLC,
xine, among others.

=head1 OUTPUT TEMPLATE

The -o option allows users to indicate a template for the output file
names. The basic usage is not to set any template arguments when
downloading a single file, like in youtube-dl -o funny_video.flv
"http://some/video". However, it may contain special sequences that will
be replaced when downloading each video.

The special sequences have the format C<%(NAME)s>. To clarify, that's a
percent symbol followed by a name in parenthesis, followed by a
lowercase S. Allowed names are:

=over

=item id

The sequence will be replaced by the video identifier.

=item url

The sequence will be replaced by the video URL.

=item uploader

The sequence will be replaced by the nickname of the person who uploaded
the video.

=item title

The sequence will be replaced by the literal video title.

=item stitle

The sequence will be replaced by a simplified video title, restricted to
alphanumeric characters and dashes.

=item ext

The sequence will be replaced by the appropriate extension (like C<flv>
or C<mp4>).

=item epoch

The sequence will be replaced by the Unix epoch when creating the file.

=back

As you may have guessed, the default template is C<%(id)s.%(ext)s>. When
some command line options are used, it's replaced by other templates
like C<%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s>. You can specify your own.
